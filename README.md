#OpenSystemBench - OSB

OpenSystemBench will be a system performance benchmarking application that is open source and returns meaningful statistics.  It will run workloads that stress various system components such as CPU and memory.  This application will have an easy to use desktop interface along with a command-line option for systems lacking desktop environments such as servers. It will be written in C++ for its high efficiency. 

An overall score will be determined for a system based on all tests performed. More detailed results will also be available such as run times and temperatures. The operating system will be scraped to retrieve accurate system specifications such as CPU vendor or RAM frequency.  Benchmark results can be recorded into a CSV file. Verified tests on the application can be uploaded to a database for comparison against other systems. The application will display a list of the 10 highest scoring systems.

It will be similar to PCMark software but it will be open source and, therefore, free of corruption that occurs in some benchmarking software. There will be no uncertainty in the way it works because the code will be publicly available.
